# 3D Virtual Chimes
### by Kayla Beckham & Brighten Jelke
Inspired by the IEEE 3DUI contest from 2015, this project recreates orchestral chimes, also known as tubular bells, 
in virtual reality using Unity, SteamVR, and the HTC Vive (headset and two standard controllers).
## How to Build and Run

## Overall Architecture

## Important Performance Issues
Tracking the headset and controllers in the corners of the cave / HTC camera range.
## Known Bugs
The capacity of pertical effects is currently set to 100. It is difficult, but possible, to hit the capacity. No partical 
effects will be rendered for a few seconds until some of them go out of range.
## Results
